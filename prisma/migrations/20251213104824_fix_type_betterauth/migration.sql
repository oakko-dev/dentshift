  - The primary key for the `accounts` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `accounts` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The `user_id` column on the `schedules` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `sessions` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `sessions` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `subscriptions` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `subscriptions` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `users` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
